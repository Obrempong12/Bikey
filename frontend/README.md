# Bikey - Frontend

Welcome to the **Bikey Frontend** application, the user interface for the Bikey mobile platform. This frontend is designed to provide an intuitive and seamless experience for users to interact with the backend API. Built with React Native, it allows users to sign up, book motorcycle rides, manage profiles, and track their rides in real-time, ensuring security and convenience.

- Sign up and authenticate via mobile.
- View and book available motorcycle rides.
- Monitor ongoing rides in real-time.
- Manage and update user profiles.
- Complete payments using integrated Mobile Money (MoMo) or Visa Cards.

## Frontend Structure

The **Bikey Frontend** is structured into various components and pages that interact with each other to provide a smooth user experience.

### Main Pages:

1. **Authentication**:
   - **Login Screen**: To authenticate users with their credentials.
   - **Signup Screen**: To register new users.

2. **Ride Management**:
   - **Available Rides Screen**: To view a list of nearby rides.
   - **Ride Details Screen**: To view detailed ride information before booking.
   - **Ride Tracking Screen**: To track the progress of an ongoing ride.

3. **Profile Management**:
   - **Profile Screen**: To view and edit the userâ€™s profile information.

4. **Payment**:
   - **Payment Screen**: To choose and complete payments using Mobile Money or Visa.

### Core Components:

- **Navigation**: React Navigation for navigating between pages.
- **State Management**: Redux for managing the global state of the application (e.g., user info, ride status).
- **API Communication**: Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend.
- **Location Services**: Google Maps API for tracking and displaying locations.

## Testing

To ensure the frontend is working as expected, the following testing procedures are implemented:

1. **Unit Tests**: Each component and page has unit tests to check functionality.
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end testing to verify interactions between frontend and backend.

To run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

This will run all tests using Jest and React Native Testing Library.

## Future Improvements

- **Push Notifications**: For ride updates and real-time alerts.
- **Language Localization**: Supporting multiple languages for a diverse user base.
- **Dark Mode**: An optional dark theme for the user interface.
